# Flask-Web-App
With this web application I built in two weeks, I was amongst the top 40 invited to attend 
Capital One's Software Engineering Summit in Clarendon, Virginia.

This is for Part 2 (The Coding Challenge by MindSumo) of my application for Capital One's Software 
Engineering Summit. This is a web application built using Flask in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
that helps people find their next place to eat at in a much easier way. This application plots their
current location and their ideal restaurants based on the type of food and price range given on a map. 
They are able to see where the restaurants are relative to their location. This web application uses 
HTML5 Geolocation to obtain the user's current location and Yelp's Fusion API to search for restaurants 
based on the user's current location (latitude, longitude), type of food, and price range($, $$, $$$, $$$$). 
To use the web application, go to https://amogh-flask-web.herokuapp.com/.
