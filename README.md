# Restaurant Yelp Fusion API Flask Web Application
With this web application I built in two weeks, I was amongst the top 40 invited to attend 
Capital One's Software Engineering Summit in Clarendon, Virginia.

This is for Part 2 (The Coding Challenge by MindSumo) of my application for Capital One's Software 
Engineering Summit. This is a Flask web application built in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
that helps people find their next place to eat at in a much easier way. This application plots their
current location and their ideal restaurants based on the type of food and price range given on a map. 
They are able to see where the restaurants are relative to their location. This web application uses 
HTML5 Geolocation to obtain the user's current location and Yelp's Fusion API to search for restaurants 
based on the user's current location (latitude, longitude), type of food, and price range($, $$, $$$, $$$$). 
To use the web application, go to https://amogh-flask-web.herokuapp.com/.

# Coronavirus Update
Added functionality and visibility to see which restaurants out of your results supports delivery, 
supports pickup, or supports both. This update is to help those in selecting a restaurant from their
ideal restaurants to order food from if they prefer a certain transaction method over another or 
don't care at all in this time of a global pandemic. Also added small option for users to input
how many restaurants they want to see in their results created just for them using the Yelp API.
